			<p>Xiamen is a coastal city located in south-east China,  with a total population of about 1.5 million. It is a sub provincial city under the Fujian province.
			Xiamen City Medical is the host of the newly implemented MEDICS system. Which allows any insured citizen of Xiamen, China to be able to register for an E-Clearance card allowing the patient to make use of thier insurance at any Xiamen City Medical's associate facility.
			What became the Xiamen City Medical was founded by Frank Tsai of Xiaban. Providing the opportunity for those with insurance to use an e-clearance card at any of Xiamen City Medical's associate facilities. And is utilized by over 420,000 users on a day to day basis.</p>
			<p>Frank Tsai is in charge of getting the new medical insurance clearance system (MEDICS) on track for the city of Xiamen. The past iteration of the insurance system faced many issues regarding the inefficiency of cash transactions. The goal of the MEDICS e-clearance system is to simplify the medical supply chain and allow hospitals, banks, patients, and the insurance bureau to have seamless and cashless interactions. We are Xiban, an external consulting company looking to automate and enhance the prior medical insurance system in order to reduce costs, improve turnaround time, and improve claim throughput.</p>
